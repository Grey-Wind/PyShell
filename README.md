# PyShell

A library that allows quick execution of shell commands.

------

This project ~~permanently stopped updating, but I made a similar project~~ revived (miracle.jpg), the new version of the past idea is basically all implemented, fixed a lot of bugs. It is estimated that it will continue to stop and wait for an unknown time to continue to return.

------

Here is a similar library for C#, which is also being reworked.

My new project can also be used in Python programs and is expected to be more stable than this.
